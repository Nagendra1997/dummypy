I am currently using Mesibo Cloud services. If I enable on-premise how long will it take to switch connection to my server?: |
As soon as you enable On-Premise in the console, your users will start getting connected to your On-Premise server. Please ensure that you have made the necessary configuration in the console and the Running Status in console displays your hostname before you enable On-Premise.

Can I switch from Mesibo On-Premise hosted on my service back to Mesibo Cloud Service? : | 
Yes, if you would like your users to switch from On-Premise server to Mesibo cloud server, first disable On-Premise in the console and then stop your docker container which is running mesibo. Your users will now get connected to Mesibo Cloud

On-Premise vs Cloud offering, Which one is better? : |
You can't go wrong with either model. Although our cloud services let you start immediately, there are several reasons why you need On-Premise, and one of the key reasons is to have ultimate control over your data. More than ever before, it has become imperative to protect your data and be more sensitive towards your user data, be it personal data, financial data, medical records, GDPR, HIPPA, unauthorized harvesting of your data, companies selling, misusing your data for advertisement, to name a few. 
Mesibo On-premise offering puts you complete control of your data since everything runs on your own servers.If you do not wish to host Mesibo on your own server infrastructure, you have the option of using the Cloud offering by Mesibo. Also, even when running On-Premise, you can always use Mesibo cloud as a back-up, which gives you best of the both worlds.

I do not wish to host Mesibo on my server,what should I do ? : |
If you do not wish to host Mesibo on your own server infrastructure, you have the option of using the Cloud offering by Mesibo. Also, even when running On-Premise, you can always use Mesibo cloud as a back-up, gives you best of the both worlds.

Should I recompile my application to run with Mesibo On-Premise ? : |
Absolutely not! There are zero changes to the way you deploy your application or use our APIs. With Mesibo On-Premise you have greater control over your data since all call and messages are routed through your own server and you also have the added advantage of having data backed up to your own server.

What happens if I have enabled on premise and my server is not running? : |
There are two possibilities -
- If Auto Fallback is not enabled and your server is not running and you have enabled On-Premise, your users will not be able to connect and hence will fail to get your service.
- If Auto Fallback is enabled and your server is not running and you have enabled On-Premise, your users will switch to Mesibo cloud after a few retries


What happens if my server disconnects due to a network issue while hosting on premise? : | 
In the case of an issue with your on premise connection, mesibo will try to reconnect to your server for a few times. If that fails and you have fall back to cloud option enabled, your application will be connected to mesibo cloud. Otherwise mesibo will continue to reconnect to your server. Please check your server logs for further troubleshooting.

What happens if I am connected to my server and disable On-Premise from console? : |
If your server is running, your users will continue to connect to your On-Premise server since they do not know about you disabling On-Premise server.
However, if you also stop your docker container running Mesibo, your users will be redirected to Mesibo cloud after a few retries and will connect there since you have disabled On-Premise.


What is Auto fallback to cloud option ? : |
In the configuration console for On-Premise if you enable auto fall back to cloud, Mesibo will automatically connect to cloud service ,if your dataceneter is having an issue. Note that, some of the offline messages will not be delivered in fallback mode since Mesibo cloud has no access to your database.
