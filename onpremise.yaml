On-Premise vs Cloud offering, Which one is better? : |
 You can't go wrong with either model. Although our cloud services let you start immediately, there are several reasons why you need On-Premise, and one of the key reasons is to have ultimate control over your data. More than ever before, it has become imperative to protect your data and be more sensitive towards your user data, be it personal data, financial data, medical records, GDPR, HIPPA, unauthorized harvesting of your data, companies selling, misusing your data for advertisement, to name a few. 
 Mesibo On-premise offering puts you in complete control of your data since everything runs on your own servers.If you do not wish to host Mesibo on your own server infrastructure, you have the option of using the Cloud offering by Mesibo. Also, even when running On-Premise, you can always use Mesibo cloud as a back-up, which gives you best of the both worlds.

What is the cost for on-premise and how billing is changed compared to Mesibo Cloud solution?: |
 It comes to you at no additional cost - you only pay for the number of active users per month! No monthly commitment, no bandwidth charges, no storage charges, or any other hidden charges. This makes On-premise even more economical and attractive than our Cloud offering.
